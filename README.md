# TEAM-GENERATOR
## **Description**
This is an application that will ask for user input to fill out various fields that will make up their team page. 

This was another fun project. I got a better understanding and pratice of test-driven developement. Also being introduced to another package,Jest, and learning it's functionality through TDD was a good learning experience as well.
